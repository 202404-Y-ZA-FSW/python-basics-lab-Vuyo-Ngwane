# Number Guessing Game

## Overview

This is a simple Python application where users try to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. The program will give feedback on whether the guessed number is too high, too low, or correct. This project will help you practice working with variables, functions, conditionals, and loops.

## Instructions
- The program will generate a random number between 1 and 100.  
- You will be prompted to guess the number.
- After each guess, the program will inform you if your guess is too high, too low, or correct.
- The game will continue until you guess the correct number.
- Once the correct number is guessed, the program will display the total number of attempts it took you to guess correctly.
